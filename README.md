## Inputs

### Counts Table

The standard table generated by featureCounts tool.

First line is a comment.

The structure of the table should be like this:

| Geneid  | Chr | Start | End | Length | /path/to/mapping_1.bam | /path/to/mapping_2.bam
| ------- | --- | ----- | --- | ------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------
| ------- | --- | ----- | --- | ------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------

Please, prepare your table to this format.

The most important columns which should be there are `Geneid` and "bam" columns with coverage.
If you don't have `Chr`, `Start`, etc additional columns, add empty ones instead.
